Compilation 
===========

Prerequisites
-------------

To compile JABS, you will need have the Java Development Kit installed. It does
not need to be on your system path. If you are on GNU/Linux, you will also need
to have JavaFX installed, since this usually comes separately from OpenJDK.

Compilation can run with Windows Command Prompt or any *nix shell.

How to Build
------------
Run build.cmd to compile on Windows.
Run build.sh to compile on Mac OS X and other *nix operating systems.

After running the build shell script, the program folder 'deployment' will be
created. Copy the folder deployment wherever you want to take the program.

Other files:
    build-dbg.cmd/sh : Builds with debugging symbols.
    build-dbm.cmd/sh : Builds the program but with DatabaseManager command
    line as the main class. This is not a complete program interface and it is
    used for developer testing.


Installation
============

Setup
-----
After compilation, copy the contents of the deployment folder wherever you 
want to install JABS.  Note that the files JABS uses are all in the same 
directory, with no registry entries or files hidden away. Be sure to copy 
all files in the JABS directory when moving the program if you want to keep 
your data.

How to Run
----------
Open jabs.jar by double-clicking it in your file browser.

You can also run jabs on the command line to see logging output:
$ java -jar jabs.jar
